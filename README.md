# Data-Mining

I am interested in Data Science as my concentration, This is the first step towards it. I am trying to learn how to Analyze data and derive some useful insights from them

1. DataAnalysis:
In this code, I have performed some Analysis using Numpy and Pandas libraries in Python
I also had to perform some Data Cleaning and Transformation for effecient Analysis and accurate conclusions
2. DataAnalysis&Visualization:
In this code, I have performed some Analysis on web log files. Also, I have visualized the analysis using plotly to make implications easier.
3. BayesianKnowledgeTracing:
In this code, I have implemented the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model to calculate probability that a student already knows a skill/knowledge component(KC) before solving the question to which that skill is relevant.
I have also calculated the probability that student will perform a correct action on the question by using the correct performance equation
4. In this Code, classification algorithm is implemented on the Dataset. Before classification, data is randomly balanced.
   Classification algorithms predict whether a student is ONTASK or OFFTASK. Which is done in two ways:
      o By splitting the data in 70/30 train-test split
      o By using 10-fold cross-validation
   Performance Evaluation is also performed to compare the results of all algorithms
