# Data-Mining

I am interested in Data Science as my concentration, This is the first step towards it. I am trying to learn how to Analyze data and derive some useful insights from them

1. DataAnalysis:
In this code, I have performed some Analysis using Numpy and Pandas libraries in Python
I also had to perform some Data Cleaning and Transformation for effecient Analysis and accurate conclusions
2. DataAnalysis&Visualization:
In this code, I have performed some Analysis on web log files. Also, I have visualized the analysis using plotly to make implications easier.
3. BayesianKnowledgeTracing:
In this code, I have implemented the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model to calculate probability that a student already knows a skill/knowledge component(KC) before solving the question to which that skill is relevant.
I have also calculated the probability that student will perform a correct action on the question by using the correct performance equation
